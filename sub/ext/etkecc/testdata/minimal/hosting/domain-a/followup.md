Hello,
We're thrilled to share that your Matrix server order is confirmed! ðŸŽ‰

SSH: You are ordering a hosted/managed server. We will set up and manage the server on your behalf. Still, you can get full SSH access to this server. **If** you wish to have SSH access to this server, send us your public SSH key and a list of IP addresses from which you wish to access it.

We see that you have something on your base domain.
**If** that's a domain registrar's (parking) page and/or you intend to serve base domain (example.com) from the matrix server, just add the `@` DNS record pointing to the server IP and tell us about that.
**If** that's your website and/or you intend to serve base domain from some other server, you should add the following HTTPS redirects (HTTP 301):

* [example.com/.well-known/matrix/server](https://example.com/.well-known/matrix/server) -> [matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/server](https://matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/server)
* [example.com/.well-known/matrix/client](https://example.com/.well-known/matrix/client) -> [matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/client](https://matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/client)
* [example.com/.well-known/matrix/support](https://example.com/.well-known/matrix/support) -> [matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/support](https://matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/support)
  To learn more about why these redirects are necessary and what the connection between the base domain (example.com) and the Matrix domain (matrix.example.com) is, read the following guide: [etke.cc/help/faq#why-are-well-known-redirects-on-the-base-domain-important](https://etke.cc/help/faq#why-are-well-known-redirects-on-the-base-domain-important)
