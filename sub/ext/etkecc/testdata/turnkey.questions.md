Hi there,
We got your order and have some questions before the setup.

SSH: You are ordering a hosted/managed server. We will set up and manage the server on your behalf. Still, you can get full SSH access to this server. **If** you wish to have SSH access to this server, send us your public SSH key and a list of IP addresses from which you wish to access it.

```
