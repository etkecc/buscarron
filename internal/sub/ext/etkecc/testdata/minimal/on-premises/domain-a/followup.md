Hello,
We're thrilled to share that your Matrix server order is confirmed! ðŸŽ‰

Server: please, create an x86/amd64 VPS with any Debian-based distro. Minimal comfortable configuration for a Matrix server without any additional components: 1vCPU, 2GB RAM.
Add our SSH keys ([etke.cc/keys.txt](https://etke.cc/keys.txt)) to your server, open the required ports ([etke.cc/order/status/#ports-and-firewalls](https://etke.cc/order/status/#ports-and-firewalls)) send us your server's IP address, the username (with permissions to call sudo), and password (if set).

Please, ensure [all mandatory ports are open](https://etke.cc/order/status/#ports-and-firewalls).

Please, add the following DNS entries (ensure that the CloudFlare proxy is disabled, as it's known to cause issues with Matrix Federation):

* matrix    A record    server IP
* matrix    TXT record    v=spf1 ip4:server IP -all
* _dmarc.matrix    TXT record    v=DMARC1; p=quarantine;
* default._domainkey.matrix    TXT record    v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=TODO

We see that you have something on your base domain.
**If** that's a domain registrar's (parking) page and/or you intend to serve base domain (example.com) from the matrix server, just add the `@` DNS record pointing to the server IP and tell us about that.
**If** that's your website and/or you intend to serve base domain from some other server, you should add the following HTTPS redirects (HTTP 301):

* [example.com/.well-known/matrix/server](https://example.com/.well-known/matrix/server) -> [matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/server](https://matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/server)
* [example.com/.well-known/matrix/client](https://example.com/.well-known/matrix/client) -> [matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/client](https://matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/client)
* [example.com/.well-known/matrix/support](https://example.com/.well-known/matrix/support) -> [matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/support](https://matrix.example.com/.well-known/matrix/support)
  To learn more about why these redirects are necessary and what the connection between the base domain (example.com) and the Matrix domain (matrix.example.com) is, read the following guide: [etke.cc/order/status#delegation-redirects](https://etke.cc/order/status#delegation-redirects)
