Hi there,
We got your order and have some questions before the setup.

Server: please, create a VPS with any Debian-based distro. Minimal comfortable configuration for a basic matrix server: 1vCPU, 2GB RAM.
Add my ssh key (https://etke.cc/ssh.key) to your server, share with me your server IP, the username (with permissions to call sudo), and password (if set).

```yaml

DNS - please, add the following entries:
@	A record	server IP
matrix	A record	server IP
```
