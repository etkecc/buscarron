Hello,
We're thrilled to share that your Matrix server order is confirmed! ðŸŽ‰

Reminder bot: What's your timezone (IANA)? Like America/Chicago, Asia/Seoul, or Europe/Berlin. [Full list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List)

Telegram: please, go to [https://my.telegram.org/apps](https://https://my.telegram.org/apps) and create a new app. Share the API ID and Hash with us

Website: to deploy a static website you have to point your base domain (the @ DNS entry) to Matrix server IP and the website source has to be available in a public git repo. Supported generators: hugo, jekyll, plain html (no generator). Are you sure you want it? If so, please, provide the website repository URL, command(-s) to build it, and in what folder the build dist is saved (usually public or dist).

SSO: You didn't mention what OIDC/OAuth2 provider you want to integrate, so here is a list of common providers - [github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/openid.md#sample-configs](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/openid.md#sample-configs). Please, send us the information required to configure it (usually it's provider name, issuer, client_id, client_secret, but that depends on the provider)

Sygnal: are you sure you want it? It's a push gateway, usable only for Matrix client app developers, so you can't use it if you don't develop your mobile Matrix app. If you want to add it, please, provide the following information: app ID(-s) (eg org.matrix.app), FCM api key, and/or APNS certificate (if used)

BorgBackup: please, provide the desired repository url (user@host:repo). We will generate an SSH key and encryption passphrase on your server. We will send you the public part of the generated SSH key. You will need to add that SSH key to your provider.

Server: please, create an x86/amd64 VPS with any Debian-based distro. Minimal comfortable configuration for a Matrix server without any additional components: 2vCPU, 2GB RAM.
Open the required ports ([etke.cc/order/status/#ports-and-firewalls](https://etke.cc/order/status/#ports-and-firewalls)) send us your server's IP address, the username (with permissions to call sudo), and password (if set).

Please, ensure [all mandatory ports are open](https://etke.cc/order/status/#ports-and-firewalls), and the following ssh key added to the **/home/TODO/.ssh/authorized_keys**: `ssh-todo TODO etke.cc`. Here is how you can do that:

1.  ensure the .ssh directory exists: `mkdir -p /home/TODO/.ssh`
2.  ensure the authorized_keys file exists: `touch /home/TODO/.ssh/authorized_keys`
3.  add the key to the authorized_keys file: `echo 'ssh-todo TODO etke.cc' >> /home/TODO/.ssh/authorized_keys`
4.  ensure the correct permissions are set on the authorized_keys file: `chmod 600 /home/TODO/.ssh/authorized_keys`
5.  ensure the correct permissions are set on the .ssh directory: `chmod 700 /home/TODO/.ssh`
6.  ensure the correct ownership is set on the .ssh directory: `chown -hR TODO:TODO /home/TODO/.ssh`

Please, add the following DNS entries:
